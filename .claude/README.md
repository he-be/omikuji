### Prompt Templates
Copy and customize prompts from `prompt-templates.md` for common tasks:

## Best Practices

1. **Always use TodoWrite**: Track complex tasks with clear status

3. **Include context**: Provide file paths and specific requirements
4. **Test-driven development**: Request implementation + tests together
5. **Coverage goals**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage
6. **Quality gates**: Ensure lint, typecheck, and tests pass

## Project-Specific Commands

```markdown
